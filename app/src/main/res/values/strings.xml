        <b>What is the Gather App?</b>
        <br /> Gather provides a place to record and organise climate change related findings, interacts with other citizen scientists,
        and keep up to date about climate change in Australia. It encourages the participation of citizen scientists
        including, but not limited to, First Nations people, hikers, and ecologists.
        Through cataloguing these first-hand experiences of Australiaâ€™s climate,
        Gather hopes to create an extensive database of the impacts of climate change
